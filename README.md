# Silent Failure in React Native FlatList

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in React Native's FlatList component.  The issue arises when attempting to render items that contain null or undefined values.  Instead of throwing a clear error, FlatList often silently fails, leading to unexpected behavior (blank spaces, or crashes) without informative error messages.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution incorporating robust data handling to prevent this issue.

## Reproducing the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app (instructions may vary depending on your setup).
4. Observe the potential blank spaces or crashes if a null or undefined value is present in the data array.

## Solution

The provided solution adds comprehensive checks for null and undefined values within the `renderItem` function.  This ensures that only valid data is rendered, resulting in more robust and predictable behavior.  Consider adding more sophisticated error handling or fallback mechanisms for improved user experience.
